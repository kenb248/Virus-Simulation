# Virus-Simulation

Controls for Simulation:
  -Use space to start/stop simulation
  -Press "x" to infect a person
  -Press "c" to cure all people
  
To change number of people in the simulation:
  -Go to class "GraphicalWorld"
  -Go to "__init__"
  -Find variable "self.PEOPLE"
  -Change as desired default is 200

Note due to the design of the simulation too many people will make the program lag and eventually crash.
